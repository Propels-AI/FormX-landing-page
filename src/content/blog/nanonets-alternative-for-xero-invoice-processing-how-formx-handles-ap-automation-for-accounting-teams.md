Xero is a cloud accounting platform used by bookkeepers and SMB finance teams around the world. But Xero does not extract data from invoices or bank statements on its own - teams still need a third-party OCR tool to digitize documents and get them into Xero.

Nanonets is one option accounting teams consider. But it is not the only one. For teams that want fast setup, transparent pricing, and pre-built extractors that work without model training, FormX is a strong alternative - especially for Xero-based workflows handling invoices, receipts, and bank statements across multiple formats and languages.

## Why Xero Teams Need a Separate OCR Tool

Xero handles your chart of accounts, bank reconciliation, and financial reporting. What it does not do is automatically extract data from the documents your vendors and suppliers send you.

Without OCR, the workflow looks like this: receive an invoice by email or paper, open it manually, type the vendor name, invoice number, date, line items, and totals into Xero one by one, then repeat for every document. This process is slow and error-prone. Manual data entry carries a 3-5% error rate and takes 4-6 minutes per invoice on average - time that scales painfully as document volume grows.

AI OCR tools like FormX sit between your incoming documents and Xero. They extract the structured data automatically, so your team reviews exceptions rather than doing data entry.

## How FormX Extracts Data for Xero Workflows

FormX uses optical character recognition, machine learning, and natural language processing to extract structured data from invoices, receipts, and bank statements. The platform includes pre-built extractors for all three document types that work immediately without requiring custom template configuration or model training.

### Step 1 - Upload Your Documents

Upload invoices, receipts, or bank statements to FormX via the web portal or API. You can upload individual files or process batches.

### Step 2 - AI Extracts the Data

FormX automatically identifies and extracts the key fields your Xero workflow needs:

**For invoices:** invoice number, vendor name, vendor address, payment terms, line items, quantities, unit prices, subtotals, tax amounts, and totals.

**For receipts:** merchant name, date, itemized line items, and total amount.

**For bank statements:** account holder name, opening and closing balances, issue date, and all individual transactions with dates, descriptions, and amounts.

The system handles documents in any language without pre-configuration. For teams processing invoices from international suppliers, FormX automatically detects the document language and applies the correct extraction logic - covering diverse currencies, date formats, and regional invoice structures.

### Step 3 - Export to Xero-Compatible Formats

Export your extracted data as CSV, Excel, or JSON. These formats can be imported into Xero manually through the bill import workflow, or automated using Zapier or N8N.

### Step 4 - Import into Xero

Import via Xero's CSV import for bank statements, or use Zapier to trigger automatic imports when new files land in Google Drive.

## Key Capabilities for Xero Accounting Teams

### Multi-Format Document Handling

Accounting teams receive documents in many formats: digital PDFs, scanned paper invoices, photos taken on a phone, and low-quality images from older copiers. FormX pre-processes documents before extraction - correcting skewed images, improving contrast on faded scans, and handling mixed-quality batches. This matters for real-world workflows where not every document arrives in perfect condition.

### Multi-Language and Multi-Entity Support

For firms managing clients across multiple countries, or businesses processing invoices from international suppliers, FormX handles documents across languages without separate workflows. The same platform that processes a clean English invoice also handles a French or German supplier document - useful for multi-entity organizations using Xero to manage accounts across different regions.

### Zapier and N8N Integration

FormX integrates with Zapier and N8N to build no-code automation workflows. A common setup: new invoices emailed to a shared inbox trigger a Zapier workflow that sends them to FormX, extracts the data, and creates a row in Google Sheets formatted for Xero import - all without manual intervention.

### No Image Storage

Documents processed via the FormX API are handled in-memory and disposed of once extraction is complete. The platform does not store uploaded images. All API calls are encrypted with HTTPS. This matters for accounting teams handling client financial documents with confidentiality requirements.

## FormX vs. Nanonets for Xero Workflows

**Choose FormX if:**

  * Your team wants to start processing immediately without training a model
  * You need transparent, predictable pricing starting at $299/month
  * You work with international suppliers or clients across multiple languages
  * Your Xero workflow involves invoices, receipts, and bank statements in one platform
  * You need Zapier or N8N automation without API development



## The Business Case for Automating Xero Invoice Processing

The cost of manual document processing is well-documented. Processing time averages 4-6 minutes per invoice. A team processing 500 invoices a month spends roughly 40 hours on data entry alone.

Businesses that automate document processing with FormX have achieved 80% reductions in processing time and 64% reductions in data processing costs. At the Starter plan level ($299/month for 3,000 pages), the math is straightforward for any team processing more than a handful of documents per day.

FormX's ROI tracking shows a 178% monthly return on investment for automated document processing workflows - with the technology paying for itself in under 8 business days.
